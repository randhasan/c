Three programs that essentially read and write from files to convert a made-up container format known as a Compressed Bitmap Image to a Bitmap Image File.

1. Program that can be called with the following displays both the CBM header and the palette:
$ ./cbm2bmp --info image.cbm
=== CBM Header ===
Magic: 0x7449
Width: 958
Height: 718
Number of colors: 16
Color array offset: 22
Image array offset: 70

=== Palette (R, G, B) ===
Color 0: (24, 36, 21)
Color 1: (37, 66, 26)
Color 2: (56, 91, 41)
Color 3: (77, 113, 63)
Color 4: (5, 9, 5)
Color 5: (53, 51, 49)
Color 6: (102, 102, 103)
Color 7: (75, 74, 72)
Color 8: (104, 139, 86)
Color 9: (176, 188, 219)
Color 10: (150, 164, 172)
Color 11: (127, 146, 128)
Color 12: (123, 78, 204)
Color 13: (198, 208, 129)
Color 14: (219, 119, 118)
Color 15: (163, 41, 75)

2. Program that can be called with the following generates the bmp file from the argument:
$ ./cbm2bmp --convert image.cbm image.bmp

3. Program that can be called with the following displays both of the bmp headers:
$ ./cbm2bmp --bmp-info image.bmp
=== BMP Header ===
Type: BM
Size: 2073654
Reserved 1: 0
Reserved 2: 0
Image offset: 54

=== DIB Header ===
Size: 40
Width: 960
Height: 720
# color planes: 1
# bits per pixel: 24
Compression scheme: 0
Image size: 0
Horizontal resolution: 0
Vertical resolution: 0
# colors in palette: 0
# important colors: 0
